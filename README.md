What the project does?
This program uses the requests and bs4 modules to scrape book information from the website books.toscrape.com. The extracted data includes "the book title, price, star rating, and cover image link". The data is stored in a table named book within a database called "bookToScrapeDB.sqlite". Since the books on the website are spread across multiple pages, this program retrieves and stores information from the first 10 pages of the site.
